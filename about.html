				have 6 years experience in 3d-Modeling, Animation, Robotics, and Information Technology. I have 
				many useful skillsets to contribute to several industries, with proficiency in many design programs 
				and craftsmanship of traditional fabrication techniques, I am capable of delegating tasks and time 
				needed to complete large projects at any stage. I strive to improve my planning, improve efficiency, 
				and I have the propensity to be resourceful.  
				During my time time in college, I spent my first two years at SNHU studying Information 
				Technology: Robotics and Artificial Intelligence where I began learning computer building, and 
				software development. I learned the fundamentals of scripting Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and 
				later C++ on an extracurricular Arduino projects. I changed majors halfway through my degree into 
				Graphic Design: 3D Modeling and Animation where I was eager to learn a lot of design programs, 
				earning my bachelor's degree in May of 2022. 
				I earned a Latin honors “cum laude” with a 3.617 GPA, respectfully. I was thrilled to learn from 
				Southern New Hampshire University that I had been nominated, and later through leadership 
				coaching inducted into the National Society for Leadership and Success (NSLS) in 2021. The NSLS is a 
				national honor society whose Greek motto is "Sigma Alpha Pi". This milestone opened my eyes to 
				what I could achieve with the right mindset. With a touch of good mentorship, I make an exceptional 
				leader. I enjoy taking a leading role in developing a contribution to my community. It is irreplaceable 
				in a today’s world to be a part of a community.  
				I have an active Class A commercial tractor trailer driving license with a tanker endorsement. With 
				an additional 9 years of service driving in various roles from Over-The-Road, LTL, equipment, and local 
				food delivery. In my youth, I worked as an auto stereo, alarm and remote start installer where I 
				learned the basics about complex wiring methods in low voltage systems. I attended Greater New 
				Bedford Vocational Technical High School for Collision Repair. I am proficient in repairing and building 
				with various materials such as: steel, aluminum, composites and many plastic parts all the way to 
				high quality finishes, and I am an expert in colorizing.
				I am comfortable working alone or with others and I am self sustainable working around complex 
				assemblies on top end projects. I have resolved thousands of insurance claims on vehicles. I am an 
				expert welder using MIG, TIG, and Stick methods. I have used composites and bonding materials. 
				Vehicles now have many peripheral sensors and digital system, this has been something that always 
				intrigued me which sprouted my curiosity to gain knowledge of coding and join college.
				 After work when I find time to myself, my personal life isn’t much different. I enjoy building, 
				After work when I find time to myself, my personal life isn’t much different. I enjoy building, 
				programming and flying FPV drones, as well as editing cinematic videos. I am a practicing musician 
				ocasionally for many years and have worked in editing programs such as Sony Acid Pro. I understand 
				the fundamentals of music theory, and I am mostly self taught minus a year of blues guitar lessons. I 
				enjoy painting when time allows. I also enjoy traditional sculpting. I’m active and outdoor activities 
				such as hiking, rock-climbing, camping and kayaking are a thrill. I am often taking along my cameras 
				for cinematic video and photography. I spend time in nature and in the mountains to create personal 
				space for my well-being. I am always doing new things it seems, and thanks for taking the time to 
				learn about me.
